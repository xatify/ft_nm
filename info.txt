- there are three main types of object files
	* relocatable file: holds code and data suitable for linking with other object files
	* executable file: holds a program suitable for execution
	* shared object file

object files are binary representation of programs intended to execute durictly on a processor. ???!!!

object files participate in program linking (building a program) and program execution (running a program).

ELF header:
	- resides at the beginning and holds a "road map" describing the file's organization.
sections:
	- hold the bulk of object file information for the linking view:
		* instructions
		* data
		* symbol table
		* relocation information
		* ...
program header table: (optional)
	- tells the system how to create a process image.
	- reloactable files do not need one.

section header table:
	- informations describing the file's sections.
	- each section has an entry in the table; each entry gives information such as the
	section name, size, etc,

	- files used during linking must have a section header table.


!!!! only the ELF header has a fixed position in the file.

!!!! for portability reasons, ELF uses no bit-fields.
